# the operator == is used to compare two values and return true or false.
#retorn True:
x = 5 == 5
print(x)
#retorn False:
y = 5 == 6
print(y)

# the operator == is one of the comparision operators, the others are:
#  x != y       x is not equal to y
#  x > y        x is greater than y
#  x >= y       x is greater than or equal to y
#  x < y        x is less than y
#  x <= y       x is less than or equal to y
#  x is y       x is the same as y
#  x is not y   x is not the same as y
