#first conditional statement if
#if x > 0 :
#    print(x)         only if x > 0  this line will happneded, if x > 0 is true 

# Alternative condition
# x = int(input('insire a integer: '))
# if (x % 2) == 0 :
#     print('this number is even')
# else:
#     print('this number is odd')

# Chained conditionals

# x = int(input('insire a integer: x = '))
# if x > 10:
#     print('x is greater than 10')
# elif x <10:
#     print('x is less than 10')
# elif x == 10:
#     print('x is equal to 10')
# you don't need to use else, but if you use it can be the last one and you can just use one! 
# the conditions will be check in order, so the first condition that is true will be executed and the statement will end
# so if there are more than one conditions that is true, it will just execute the first one!


# Nestled conditionnals
# onde condition can be nestled to other
# x = input('what is your name ')
# if x == 'Emily':
#     print('%s you are beautiful'%(x))
# else:
#     if x == 'Matheus':
#         print('%s is me'%(x))
#     else:
#         print('hello %s, how are you ?'%(x))
