#variables names:
Matheus = 'meu nome'
 # m@theus = 'meu nome' // wrong because it contains an illegal caracter
matheusHenrique = 'nome+Sobrenome'
_matheus = 'nome'
# 12matheus = 'nome'  // you cannot start a variable with with number

# if some variable's name that you use is returning an error, maybe it can be one of the 31 reserved words from python.
